# 体育产业的财务规模

Academicians and sport industry professionals frequently discuss, quote, and cite the size of the sportindustry in specific countries. For example, in 2015 it was estimated that the sport industry in the UnitedKingdom (UK) was a £20 billion ($31.7 million) industry supporting about 450,000 jobs (Cave, 2015). In theUnited States, the size of the sport industry grew from $47 billion in 1986 to $152 billion in 1995, a realannual growth rate of 8.8% (Rascher, 2001). King (2002) stated that the industry in the United States grew to$195 billion in 2001 (an annual growth rate of 4.24% since 1995). Milano and Chelladurai (2011) estimatedthat the industry’s size in 2005 fell somewhere in a range from a conservative number of $168.5 billion,which would indicate a slight decline in the industry’s size, to a liberal estimate of $207.5 billion, whichwould indicate modest growth. * More recently, Plunkett Research (2015) estimated the industry’s size to be$485 billion. Did the U.S. sport industry really grow by $275 billion or more from 2005 to 2015? Weredifferent industry definitions once again used in measurements of the size and scope of the industry? Or weredifferent methods used in calculations of the size of the industry?

We can determine the size of any industry by calculating its gross product. We measure the overall size ofan economy by its gross domestic product (GDP). GDP is the market value of the goods and servicesproduced within the borders of a county, state, country, or other region in a given year. To determine the sizeof the sport industry, we calculate the gross domestic sport product (GDSP). GDSP is defined as the marketvalue of a nation’s output of sport-related goods and services in a given year. This includes the value added tothe economy by the sport industry, as well as the gross product originating from the sport industry.

Efforts to measure GDSP must avoid a double count (one of the guidelines for calculating GDP), that is, theduplication of dollars that could be accounted for in two or more ways. Double counting often results in errorsin estimates of the sport industry, when secondary spending is included in the calculation. For example,players’ salaries should not be counted, because this amount is included in ticket prices. When organizationsset ticket prices, they account for the salaries of professional athletes, as these are essentially a production costor cost of goods sold (see Chapter 2). As an intermediary cost of production, salaries should not be countedseparately from ticket revenue in calculations of industry size. To count them separately is to count themtwice.

In the first major study on the size of the United States’ sport industry, Sports Inc. magazine calculated theindustry’s size at $47 billion (Sandomir, 1988). However, the study did not follow U.S. Department ofCommerce rules for computing GDP and made no effort to determine the economic impact of the industry onthe United States (Meek, 1997). Meek performed a study that did avoid double counting and resulted in thefigure of $152.2 billion for the size of the sport industry. Street and Smith’s SportsBusiness Journaldetermined that $194.64 billion was spent in sports during 2001 (King, 2002). In a subsequent description ofthis report’s methodology, Broughton (2002) noted that the amount reported was not a measure of the size ofthe industry but only a measure of sport-related spending. The author stated that when traditional economicstandards were applied (i.e., avoidance of double counting), the size of the industry was measured to be$31.76 billion. Milano and Chelladurai (2011) followed the methodology of Meek and the U.S. Department ofCommerce’s rules for calculating GDSP when they developed their ranged estimate of industry size (between$168.5 billion and $207.5 billion). In their ranged approach, all debatable GDSP expenditures were removedfrom the industry size estimate to arrive at the lower number, and all debatable expenditures were included inthe higher number. Milano and Chelladurai’s moderate estimate of industry size is $189.4 billion. Here, theestimate includes fractions of the debatable expenses.

Exhibit 1.7 shows a ten-year comparison between Milano and Chelladurai’s study, which used 2005 data,and Meek’s study, which used 1995 data, adjusted for inflation. Data are compared in six areas: (1)entertainment and recreation, (2) products and services, (3) non-sports-related advertising, (4) sportinvestment, (5) sport net exports, and (6) sport-related government expenditures. The largest sector of theindustry is sport products (e.g., Louisville Sluggers) and services (e.g., tennis lessons), accounting for overhalf of GDSP. Note that when we examine both studies in 2005 dollars, the industry in 2005 was actuallysmaller than it was in 1995, if we use Milano and Chelladurai’s moderate estimate of industry size. Onlyunder their liberal estimate of industry size can growth in the industry be seen.
