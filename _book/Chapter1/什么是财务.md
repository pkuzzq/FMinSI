# 什么是财务
财务，即关于资金的管理科学，包括会计，经济学和统计学概念的应用。在金融领域，有三个相互关联的部门：（1）货币和资本市场，（2）投资，（3）财务管理（Brigham＆Houston，2012）。货币市场是高流动性短期证券的市场;资本市场是中间或长期债务以及公司股票的市场。因此，货币和资本市场部门包括证券市场，如纽约证券交易所和芝加哥商品交易所。投资银行也属于这一领域，保险和共同基金管理也是如此。
Finance, the science of fund management, includes application of concepts from accounting, economics, and statistics. Within the world of finance, there are three interrelated sectors: (1) money and capital markets, (2) investments, and (3) financial management (Brigham & Houston, 2012). Money markets are markets for highly liquid, short-term securities; capital markets are markets for intermediate or long-term debt, as well as corporate stock. Hence, the money and capital markets sector includes securities markets such as the New York Stock Exchange and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Investment banking falls within this sector as well, as do insurance and mutual fund management.
