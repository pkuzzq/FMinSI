# 体育全行业概述

the sport industry is large and diverse. This makes classifying the industry and measuring its size andscope difficult. Further, how sport is defined affects estimates of industry size. For example,PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) estimated that the global sports industry was a £95 billion ($150.7 billion)industry in 2015 (Cave, 2015), whereas Plunkett Research (2015) estimated the value to be $1.5 trillion, or tentimes as large. Why is there such a difference in estimates? PwC and Plunkett Research are likely using twodifferent definitions of the sport industry.

In the United States, federal agencies use the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS),developed by the U.S. Census Bureau, to measure and track the business economy. Each business is classifiedas part of a larger industry. However, the sport industry is not classified as an industry in the NAICS. Instead,the sport industry as it is commonly conceived is scattered across at least 12 different industries in the NAICS(see Exhibit 1.5). The largest grouping of sport businesses is within the Arts, Entertainment, and Recreationsegment (NAICS 71).

The Arts, Entertainment, and Recreation segment is described as follows by the U.S. Department ofLabor’s Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). This segment employs a large number of seasonal and part-timeworkers. Those employed in the industry tend to be younger than employees in other industries, and wages arerelatively low. As of 2012, the BLS forecast for the industry as a whole was promising. Barring newrecessionary trends, rising incomes and increasing leisure time over the next ten years should lead to anincrease in demand in this sector, with employment growing 9.7% by 2022 (“Industry-occupation matrixdata,” 2012). Almost all leisure-time activities, other than watching movies, are included in this industrysector.

The BLS classifies this sector into three large subsectors: live performances or events; historical, cultural,or educational exhibits; and recreation or leisure activities. The live performances or events subsector includesprofessional sports, commercial sport clubs, sport promotion companies and agencies, and dog and horseracing facilities. Privately owned museums, such as the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum, arefound in the subsection for historical, cultural, or educational exhibits. The recreation and leisure activitiessubsector includes golf courses, fitness facilities, bowling centers, and health clubs. The BLS further dividesthe subsectors of the Arts, Entertainment, and Recreation segment, assigning NAICS codes to smallerdivisions. Exhibit 1.6 lists the codes for spectator and recreational sport divisions. These subsectors rangefrom sport teams and clubs to bowling centers and marinas.
