## 大学校际体育运动的财务状况

美国教育部（2014）的数据对最为成功的大学体育项目之一的俄亥俄州立大学七叶树美式足球队的财务运作提供了深入解析。在2013/2014学年，俄亥俄州立大学体育系预算为1.437亿美元，有126名教练，36个团队和1,045名运动员。该系是全国仅有的少数几个自给自足的体育系之一。例如，俄亥俄州立大学的体育系没有得到大学的任何补贴（《今日美国报》报道的230所NCAA第一类公立大学中的七个系之一；“ NCAA财务”，2014年）；其收入为2370万美元。体育部门向大学支付了1,680万美元的奖学金费用，该部门产生的收入支付了所有建筑成本，资本支出和债务偿还。目前，体育部门正在开发运动区，作为大学总体总体规划的一部分。运动区将包括一个新的综合运动场，一个学生运动员体育表演中心，一个摔跤练习设施，肖特斯坦中心售票处的扩建，一个新的溜冰场，一个室内跑道，新的室内练习场和一个室内网球设施。此外，该部门仍在为已完工的项目偿还债务，其中包括2001年对俄亥俄体育场的翻修，这是一个耗资1.94亿美元的项目（Briggs，2013）。2000年代对现有设施进行的翻新和新设施的建设帮助该部门增加了收入。该部门还采用了职业运动的收入方式，通过设置豪华包厢租金，门票附加费，个人专属座位和俱乐部团队座位促使新场馆产生收入。

佛罗里达大学运动系的规模也差不多。该部门在2013/2014学年的预算约为1.189亿美元，具有足够的财务实力来建设新设施和扩展现有设施。例如在2008年，耗资2800万美元的天堂美式足球综合体（Heavener Football Complex）开业，该综合体是在不使用国家资金的情况下建造的，前足球教练乌班·迈尔（Urban Meyer）希望以此来协助招募好球员。他觉得当时佛罗里达州的足球设施比其他东南会议设施低。对于Meyer而言，高质量，最新的设施是招募球员过程的重要组成部分。Rivals网站的国家招聘分析师Jamie Newberg同意Meyer的观点。他说，竞争的团队会不断追求最新和最出色的设施，从而获得招聘优势。佛罗里达州的天堂美式足球综合大楼现在设有足球计划的员工办公室，并在其“冠军之家”中向过去的名人致敬。体育总监杰里米·佛利（Jeremy Foley）表示，该设施的首要目标是让人们走进来，并说“哇”（“Gators的补充”，2008年）。

佛罗里达州体育部门很幸运拥有强大的发展根基。Gator Boosters公司在2014财年为佛罗里达大学运动协会（UAA）捐款3820万美元。捐款来自三个主要领域：美式足球相关（3160万美元），篮球相关（220万美元）和资本改善捐款（530万美元； Gator Boosters公司，2014年）。在为天堂美式足球综合体的筹款期间，Gator Boosters收到了一笔700万美元的捐款，以及另外16笔捐款，每笔捐款至少100万美元。这使基金会和体育部门可以避免为综合体的竣工而借钱；因此，部门和基金会不必为设施偿还债务（“Gators的补充”）。

### 关于建立新运动设施的竞赛

在诸如俄亥俄州立大学和佛罗里达大学这样的学校中，新的体育设施建设导致了一种现象，这种现象通常被称为大学体育中的军备竞赛：不断建造更大更好的设施，仅仅是为了招募关键人才。俄亥俄州立大学通过其运营预算中预留的资金来偿还其新设施的债务。由于体育部门要能自给自足，这意味着它不会从大学的一般预算或学生费用中获得任何资金，因此该部门必须在这些项目的融资期内，通过创收来抵消建筑项目的成本。佛罗里达州的幸运之处在于，个人捐赠产生了足够的收入来弥补建造新足球场的费用，因此不需要债务融资。两个体育部门都能够负担得起这些设施是非常幸运的。财务状况不佳的体育部门在设施的建设或升级方面面临艰难的决定，以便在校园内创造自己的招募“惊喜”时刻。

从南卡罗来纳大学的例子中可以看到军备竞赛对大学体育系的影响。耗资4000万美元的棒球场，可容纳8242人的棒球场于2009年开业。在开业前的十年中，棒球队定期进入到NCAA超级区域赛，并三次进入到大学世界系列赛。为了进一步提高棒球计划并吸引更多的人才，棒球总教练和大学体育部主任认为需要一个新的体育场。卡罗莱纳州体育场设有教练室，室内击球笼，球迷专用靠背座椅以及其他现代设施。鉴于当时的AAA小联盟棒球场的平均建筑成本为4000万美元至5000万美元，而AA场馆的平均建筑成本为2500万美元至3500万美元，南卡罗来纳大学的棒球场相当于高端双A或低端三A设施。实际上，该体育场是为大学队建造过的最昂贵的棒球场。相比之下，路易斯安那州立大学的Alex Box Stadium于2009年完工，最终成本为3,780万美元。德克萨斯州花费了将近2700万美元，北卡罗莱纳大学花费了2550万美元来完全重建其校园设施。即使有了新的创收运动场馆，也并非所有传统的棒球场馆都能转化利润（Morris，2008）。

时任南卡罗来纳大学体育主任的埃里克·海曼（Eric Hyman）在一次采访中表示，这座耗资4000万美元的棒球场几乎没有什么商业作为（Morris）。海曼（Hyman）负责创造在30年内每年为体育场支付190万美元债务的收入。球迷不得不支付更高的门票价格，看到优惠价格上涨，还必须支付座位执照费用。尽管在设施中产生了额外的收入，海曼指出，该部门可能无法获得足够的新收入来抵消球队和设施的费用。在2008赛季，这是球队最后一次出现在Sarge Frye球场，因为其运营预算为120万美元，收入为70万美元，赤字为50万美元。

无论卡罗莱纳州棒球队是否盈利并产生足够的收入来偿还债务，体育部门都有义务向卡罗莱纳州体育场支付年度190万美元的债务。尽管没有什么商业作为，新球场实际上可以帮助学校吸引更多的新球员，以此提高球队的表现。从2009年到2014年，南卡罗莱纳州棒球队每个赛季都在季后赛中出战，两次在NCAA地区赛和一次在超级地区赛中失利。球队在2010年至2012年间参加了大学世界系列赛。2010年和2011年，该队获得了全国冠军，并在2012年获得了第二名。从2010年至2012年，卡罗来纳州棒球队连续赢得了22场季后赛，其中包括12场连续的大学世界大赛系列，均为NCAA纪录（Gamecock Athletics,，2015）。

新设施开业后，卡罗来纳州棒球的成功激发了其他人为赢得胜利而建立的愿望。这种愿望不仅限于第一I级别的学校，而且已经传播到第III级别的学校。在NCAA第 III级别中比赛的运动员会在没有体育奖学金的情况下加入学校。在由小型文理学院组成的百年会议联盟上，几所学校已在体育设施上进行了大量投资，以招募到更好的运动员。因此，即使在以学术为重心的联赛中，争夺运动员也会导致大学运动设施上的巨额支出，导致债务负担增加。例如，2008年，葛底斯堡学院耗资2500万美元的运动设施破土动工，并于2010年完成建设。该设施有8泳道的竞赛游泳池，4泳道的热身游泳池和现代化的水疗中心。三年前，哈弗福德学院完成了2800万美元的体育设施；在2001年，乌尔西努斯学院建造了一座造价1300万美元的运动场，其中包括两个全尺寸的击球笼，四个篮球场，三个网球场，一个排球场和一条6道的200米跑道（Kelderman，2008）。

这些第III级别的新设施的资金来源与第I级别相似。一个捐赠者提供了200万美元的赠与，使葛底斯堡项目成为可能，因为捐赠者认为葛底斯堡在没有新设施的情况下处于竞争劣势。到开始建设时，该学院已从校友捐款中筹集了900万美元。学生费用的增加用来支付运营成本，每年约360,000美元。葛底斯堡的董事会借来的钱用来支付建筑的剩余费用。乌尔西努斯学院通过借贷完成了新体育设施的建设，发行了约400万美元的债券（Kelderman）。

从2014年到2017年，Power 5体育联盟的大学已经或计划花费24亿美元用于新的足球场或对现有体育场的翻新。*在NCAA的其余学校中，3.65亿美元将用于新场或翻新设施，包括1400万美元用于第III级别学校（Broughton，2014）。正如富兰克林与马歇尔学院院长所说，在第III级别内部正在进行一场“小型军备竞赛”（Kelderman）。

### The Race to Change NCAA Divisions

The arms race affects more than facilities; it also affects an institution’s choice of NCAA division. For smallerDivision I–FCS football schools, the transition to Division I–FBS from Division I–FCS can be difficult. Evenmore so may be the move to Division I from Division II; however, the lure of being a Division I institutionwas so great that the NCAA issued a four-year moratorium on new Division I applications in 2007. As of thiswriting, four universities are in the process of transitioning from Division I–FCS to Division I–FBS:Appalachian State, Georgia Southern, Old Dominion, and UNC–Charlotte. Another six are moving fromDivision II to Division I: Nebraska Omaha, Northern Kentucky, Abilene Christian, Grand Canyon, IncarnateWord, and UMASS–Lowell (NCAA, 2014).

Presbyterian College provides one example of this challenge. The school, located in Clinton, SouthCarolina, has 1,200 students, and the Carnegie Foundation has classified it among the most selective liberalarts colleges in the United States. Athletics is an important part of student life at Presbyterian. The schoolfields 16 teams—seven men’s and nine women’s. Presbyterian decided to move from Division II to Division Iin 2007, and the school was fortunate that its application was accepted prior to the NCAA’s moratorium. Onereason the school gave for the move up in classification was that similar-sized schools, such as WoffordCollege, Elon University, and Gardner-Webb University, had recently moved to Division I, and these moveshad affected recruiting at Presbyterian. Potential recruits living within a one-hour drive of PresbyterianCollege were deciding to go to similar schools two or three hours away, solely because those schools wereDivision I. Presbyterian’s head men’s basketball coach at the time felt that missing the chance to play in theNCAA Division I men’s basketball tournament was too big a recruiting obstacle (Darcy, 2007).

Presbyterian was fortunate that it was accepted into a conference, the Big South, two days after announcingits move to Division I, although the school would play without an affiliation the first year. Beginning in the2008/2009 academic year, the school’s teams competed in the conference, although they were ineligible forconference championships and NCAA post-season play until they earned full NCAA Division I certification,which occurred prior to the start of the 2012/2013 academic year.

The financial impact of a move from Division II to Division I is staggering. Presbyterian College’s movedemonstrates how both revenues and expenses are altered dramatically when a school makes this transition.During the initial transition year (2007–2008), Presbyterian had to play as an independent, meaning the schoolhad no conference affiliation. Darcy chronicled the impact of the move during the year on one ofPresbyterian’s programs, the men’s basketball team. As a result of joining the Big South conference a yearlater, in the 2008–2009 season, the men’s basketball team played only five home games but 25 road games.On its longest road trip, the team was away 11 nights, leaving in December on the day final exams ended. Theteam played in 12 states and traveled more than 13,000 miles by bus and plane. To generate revenue to pay forthe trip, the team’s road games, and the greater operating expenses at the Division I level, the coach scheduledgames with four Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) teams, three SEC teams, Ohio State, and Nebraska.Playing these major conference schools generated $650,000 in guaranteed money for Presbyterian. However,the school still did not have the funds to pay for administrative support, such as a coordinator of basketballoperations (a position found in almost all Division I basketball programs). Instead, an assistant basketballcoach had to take on those duties in that first season along with his regular coaching responsibilities. As of2014, seven years after its transition to Division I began, the athletic department’s budget has grown to $11million per year. However, revenues generated by the program totaled only $2 million (Moss, 2014).

### Other Races to Be Won

After U.S. District Judge Claudia Wilken ruled in O’Bannon v. NCAA (2014) that prohibiting football andmen’s basketball athletes from being paid for the use of their names, images, and likenesses (NIL) violatedantitrust law, changes in NCAA policy began to impact athletic departments’ budgets. New arms races began.Shortly after this ruling, the NCAA Division I Board of Directors enacted a new governance model allowingthe Power 5 conferences to create their own legislation to benefit athletes. Now, coaches can compete forrecruits by offering four-year scholarships (previously scholarships were restricted to one-year, renewablecontracts), which cover the full cost of attending a university plus at least $5,000 in licensing revenue perseason (Solomon, 2014a). The market, plus whatever NIL cap is set (no less than $5,000), will now dictatewhat men’s basketball and football recruits receive. The judge’s rules go into effect July 1, 2016, so thoserecruited during the 2015/2016 school year will be the first to be affected (Solomon, 2014b). (As of thiswriting, Judge Wilken’s decision is under appeal.) It is estimated that these new regulations will cost athleticdepartments an additional $7,500 per athlete per year (Solomon, 2015). USA Today Sports (Berkowitz &Kreighbaum, 2015) estimated the projected additional spending on athletes related to the addition of full cost-of-attendance scholarships—including tuition, travel, and personal expenses—at more than 90 schools. Forexample, the authors estimated that Auburn will spend an additional $2.1 million and The Ohio StateUniversity an additional $1.65 million. Visit the USA Today site (see Berkowitz & Kreighbaum, 2015 in theReferences) for a table summarizing additional athletic program spending by the Division I schools.

The new autonomy the Power 5 conferences and their member schools have attained has led to additionalchanges besides allowing full cost of attendance scholarships and guaranteed four-year scholarships. Onechange involves dining (Myerberg, 2015). New legislation allows college athletes to receive unlimited accessto food and snacks. Before this rule was enacted, athletes were limited to meal plans that provided three mealsa day. Now all athletes, both those on scholarship and those who are not, are receiving significant diningupgrades on campuses across the United States.

At Wisconsin, the athletic department upgraded athletes’ breakfast options and provided an enhancedtraining table and refueling stations for its athletes. Oregon now has a breakfast and brunch station that is openuntil noon each day. Schools are adding nutritionists, too, to monitor the athletes’ food options. At Nebraska,it is estimated that the new dining regulations will cost an additional $1.2 million per year. The school’s totalbudget for sports nutrition is now $3.2 million, with $2.1 million for food and supplements and $1 million forpayroll expenses, new kitchen equipment, and operating costs. Southern California expects new costs to be $1million, while Wisconsin will spend an additional $1.2 million ($842,000 for its new breakfast alone).

These changes suggest that the way athletic departments feed their athletes could become a recruitingadvantage. Wisconsin athletic director Barry Alvarez stated that the recruiting benefit was not the intent of theunlimited food legislation, but it might lead to an arms race in dining like the ones that exist for practice fieldsand weight rooms. According to Alvarez, “If we have it and someone else doesn’t have it, then we have anadvantage” (Myerberg, para. 25).

Overall, the size and complexity of athletic department budgets have grown dramatically as the arms racecontinues through the 2010s. Whether it is construction of new athletic facilities, a move to a higher division,or the adaptation to new NCAA legislation, the impact on the athletic department’s finances can be dramatic.

### SIDEBAR 14.A

University of Alabama–Birmingham football: The cost of on-field success

In 1996, the University of Alabama–Birmingham (UAB) moved its athletic department and football
program from Division I-FCS to Division I–FBS. As with many programs that have made this move
recently, the hope was to use the football program to help meet the university’s mission and to create a
new identity for the university. However, by 2014 UAB decided to terminate its football program—the
first Division I-FBS program to drop its football team since the University of the Pacific dropped its
program in 1995. The same year that UAB decided to terminate it, the UAB football program had its
best on-field success in ten years, becoming bowl eligible for the first time since 2004. Despite this on-
field success, the financial costs were too high for UAB, as approximately 67 % of the athletic
department’s budget was subsidized by the university (Strauss & Schonbrun, 2014).

A comprehensive review by UAB of its athletic program cited increases in costs due to new NCAA
legislation relating to cost-of-attendance payments to players, increasing facility costs, and increasing
coaching costs as reasons for the program’s termination. The review estimated that the university would
have had to provide over $100 million in subsidies to the athletic department from 2015 through 2020.
The review indicated that to remain competitive in Conference USA (C-USA), the football program
would need another $49 million plus over $22 million in facility improvements. UAB planned to funnel
its footballsavings into supporting its remaining “priority” sports in the hopes of competing for
conference and national championships in those sports (Greer, 2014).

However, in less than a year, the administrators at UAB changed their minds. Despite acknowledged
programmatic losses and heavy subsidies from the university and students through their fees, UAB
President Ray Watts announced on June 1, 2015, that the school would not drop its football program.
The university commissioned a second study on the football program and found that it would need only
$17.2 million in additional revenues over the next five years to remain competitive, plus $12 million for
a new football practice facility (Nocera, 2015). The new study stated that the first study underestimated
what the school would receive in revenues from the first College Football Playoff payment. Also, the
first study failed to consider that the school, without a football team, would no longer be a member of C-
USA (Dufresne, 2015).

In announcing the return of the program, President Watts said that monies would need to be raised to
cover the expenses required to remain competitive, as the university would not be increasing its current
$20 million subsidy of athletics. Just prior to the June 1 announcement, corporate leaders in Birmingham
had pledged enough money to cover the additional $17.2 million five-year costs and had also raised
significant amounts of money to build the new practice facility (Nocera). The team is expected to return
to the field in 2016.
